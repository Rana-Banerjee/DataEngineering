# DataEngineering
Project files for Data Lake excercise
# Purpose of this database:
This project is designed for a fictional company called sparkify. The objective is to to process the big data (song and log data) generated by the users
using spark. This will enable in generating further analytical insights.
# Schema
The schema of the datalae is as follows:
Fact Table
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
Dimension Tables
users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

# ELT pipeline:
The ELT pipeline first processes the song data and the log_data to create the Dimension Tables
The songplays fact table is then created by joining and filtering the relevant dimension tables
