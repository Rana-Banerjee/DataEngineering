# DataEngineering
Project files for Data Lake excercise
# Purpose of this database:
<p> This project is designed for a fictional company called sparkify. 
  <br> The objective is to to process the big data (song and log data) generated by the users using spark. 
  <br> This will enable in generating further analytical insights. </p>
  
# Schema
The schema of the datalake is as follows: <br>

## Fact Table
<ol>
<li> songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong` <br>
<ol> 
  <li> songplay_id, <li> start_time, <li> user_id, <li> level, <li> song_id, <li> artist_id, <li> session_id, <li> location, <li> user_agent</ol>
  </ol>
## Dimension Tables
<ol>
<li>users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
<li>songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
<li>artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
<li>time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday </p>
</ol>

# ELT pipeline:
<p>
The ELT pipeline first processes the song data and the log_data to create the Dimension Tables <br>
The songplays fact table is then created by joining and filtering the relevant dimension tables </p>
